Opencart Overclocked - Community Edition

General:

Opencart Overclocked Edition is a community project aimed at making Opencart Shopping Cart faster, richer, leaner and even more user friendly. 
To achieve this, every line of code inside every file has been checked, adjusted and corrected when necessary, in accordance with the official OpenCart Coding Standards. 
Opencart Overclocked Edition is based originally on Opencart v1.5.6.4 but most scripts have been updated or replaced by newer, better or faster versions. 
Many extra features have also been added, most of them in response to user feedback from the Opencart Forum.
