Opencart Overclocked - Community Edition
-----------------------------------------

Description:

Opencart Overclocked Edition is a community project aimed at making Opencart Shopping Cart faster, richer, leaner and even more user friendly. 
To achieve this, every line of code inside every file has been checked, adjusted and corrected when necessary, in accordance with the official OpenCart Coding Standards. 
Opencart Overclocked Edition is based originally on Opencart v1.5.6.4 but most scripts have been updated or replaced by newer, better or faster versions. 
Many extra features have also been added, most of them in response to user feedback from the Opencart Forum.

Project Philosophy:

Opencart Overclocked Edition's main objective is to keep the code simple, efficient and flexible for the final user, aka the shop owner. 
OpenCart always has been a great tool for people wanting to start and run their own business. Not only because it is open-source, but also because up to version 1.5.6.4 the code was pure HTML, PHP and CSS, making it very easy to customise and tweak with only limited coding skills or even no experience at all.
For this reason Opencart Overclocked Edition is based on OpenCart v1.5.6.4, and its ambition is to become the most user friendly, the most stable, the most secure, the most practical and the easiest open-source shopping cart package available.
Each new release will bring newer and better features, upgraded scripts, bug fixes and general improvements. Being a "Community Edition" means that anybody can get involved, you don't need to be a "Coding Guru" to participate because it is not about the code, it is about the ideas!
